This is a post that I intend to update as my desktop changes, be it small or a complete overhaul.

I saw this on someone else's website and thought it was a cool idea, to be able to see over the years how much or how little has changed.

I found that POP_OS had their <a href="https://github.com/pop-os/shell" target="_blank">pop shell</a> tiling feature which could give me i3's functionality with less setup/config.

After a few small changes to the layout and applications this was my desktop for a while.

I made the switch to Void Linux, so I had to leave gnome+pop-shell and use xfce+i3.
