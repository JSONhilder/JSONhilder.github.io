I personally am a fan of vim particularly <a href="#">neovim</a>, I use it every day as my go to editor for work and any text editing.

I have dabbled with <a href="#">Emacs(doom)</a> and also really enjoyed it but found that for what I need, neovim works just fine but who knows maybe one day I will abandon my heretic ways and join the church of Emacs!

Both of these text editors stock are relatively bare bones and you are required to personally edit its configuration file(s) and add whatever functionality you need. I am skimming over those details as thats an entire topic on its own and there are abundant resources on how to do so.

Rather than doing all the configuration youself however you can opt for a distribution such as for neovim, Astro Vim or Lunar Vim and Emacs Doom. It creates all the configuration for you and all you need to do is jump in and work optionally you can tweak or extend the defaults to you liking.

The "problem" I have seen lately is that on the net people have strong opposing opinions, some are all for distros feeling that they help you get started faster with less confusion, while the other side of the fence is not and feels they are bloated and you should you know configuration extensively claiming that is the point of customising it to your own needs.

I have given this abit of thought and really believe there is nothing wrong with distributions and if used can really allieviate some of the nusances of maintaining your own config and will outline why I think so.

Before that however I think its required for a new user of these text editors and any software for that matter to "read the manual", understand at least the basics before jumping head first into a large config/distro but they dont need to be an expert to me that seems counter productive.

- Most distros are based around programming
- Basic nessescities for said programming dont need to be so customised, an LSP, linting, syntax, file tree, built in terminal
- Shared config that the users and maintainers have similar project structure and layout. It may not be exactly how you would make yours but its pretty close or you just like the layout and find it easy to digest.
- Maintaining the updates to plugins etc can be managed by more than just yourself, no more updating plugins to find a bunch of errors on startup.
- The above can be annoying and gets in the way of just doing your work
- Extensibly, add what you need disable what you dont, if the project has been setup well this would really give the best of both worlds.

I feel the hate on these distributions is really short sited and not needed, ultimately if you feel your custom config for your specific setup then all the more power to you but these distributions not only have value to its user but allows for newer users to try the project out and get a feel of what it can be like.

Things to cover:
- intro
- what are text editor distros
    - doom emacs
    - astro/nv chad
- people complaining about em
- why they aren't bad
    - managing a custom config solo can be annoying at times
    - having a like minding/setup of a config managed by multiple people seems like a win
- outro (you dont have to use them)
