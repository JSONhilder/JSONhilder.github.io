This is my first post that I intend to comeback and update as the tools I use on a daily basis change.

I think it's helpful to have a more curated list somewhere less ephemeral than my random vim wiki notes.

#### Operating System:
- Pop!_OS with tiling enabled
    - It's a window manager including gaps without much config needed lets me just get to work
- Gnome Tweaks
- Just perfection extension
- Simply workspaces extension

#### Editors:
- Neovim + Tmux
- Vscode (Mainly for the liveshare feature)

#### Shell:
- zsh
- oh my zsh

#### CLI Utilities:
- lf
- Ripgrep
- fzf
- Xclip
- Git
- Lazygit
- Lazydocker
- GNU stow
- Newsboat
- Mpv

##### Applications:
- xfce4-terminal
- Megasync
- Ghex
- Dbeaver

Alot of these tools require some sort of config file that I have tweaked to my liking, if you're interested, here's a link to my <a href="https://github.com/jasonhilder/dotfiles" target="_blank">dotfiles</a>.
